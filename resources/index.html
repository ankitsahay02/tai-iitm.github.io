    <h2>Critical Transitions</h2>
    <p>
Many complex systems such as turbulent thermo-fluid systems, climate systems, financial markets, power
grids, infectious diseases exhibit critical transitions where the system shifts abruptly from one state to
another. Such critical transitions can have undesirable or even catastrophic consequences including
failure of space missions, power blackouts, extreme weather, extinction of species in ecosystems and
sudden crash of financial markets.
    <p>
    
    <p>
    Recent work has shown that there is indeed an architecture to such transitions. It may appear surprising
that disparate phenomena such as the instability of a power grid, extreme climatic events and a
thermoacoustic transition could have anything in common. The behavior of complex systems is more often
than not, independent of the details of the problem, with fundamentally different physical systems
displaying similar dynamic behavior.
    <p>

<p>
This seminar series plans to bring together experts from the applied, as well as theoretical aspects of critical transitions. We are planning to have talks spread across a wide spectrum, ranging from, but not limited to, climate to combustion to financial markets to ecology to neuroscience. This series presents an opportunity to foster collaborations as well as ask questions on the common subject of "tipping points", which forms an important part in a wide array of subjects .
