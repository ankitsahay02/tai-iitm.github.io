    <h2>Critical Transitions</h2>
    
    <p>
Many complex systems such as turbulent thermo-fluid systems, climate systems, financial markets, power grids, infectious diseases exhibit critical transitions where the system shifts abruptly from one state to another. Such critical transitions can have undesirable or even catastrophic consequences, including failure of space missions, power blackouts, extreme weather, extinction of species in ecosystems, and sudden financial markets crash.
    <p>
    
    <p>
Recent work has shown that there is indeed an architecture to such transitions. It may appear surprising that disparate phenomena such as the instability of a power grid, extreme climatic events, and a thermoacoustic transition could have anything in common. More often than not, the behavior of complex systems is independent of the details of the problem, with fundamentally different physical systems displaying similar dynamic behavior.
    <p>

    <p>
This seminar series plans to bring together experts from the applied and theoretical aspects of critical transitions. We plan to have talks spread across a broad spectrum, ranging from, but not limited to, climate to combustion to financial markets to ecology to neuroscience. This series presents an opportunity to foster collaborations and ask questions on the common subject of "tipping points", which forms an integral part of a wide array of subjects.
