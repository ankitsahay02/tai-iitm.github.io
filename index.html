    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
       Welcome to the registration page of the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Online Seminar Series</span> on <span style="font-weight:bold;">Critical Transitions in Complex Systems</span>, a monthly seminar series that focusses on critical transitions or "tipping points" in complex physical systems. The seminar series is jointly hosted by <a href = "https://www.iitm.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">IIT Madras</a>, Chennai, India and <a href = "https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en" style="text-decoration: none;">Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research</a>, Potsdam, Germany.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Many complex systems such as turbulent thermo-fluid systems, climate systems, financial markets, power grids, infectious diseases exhibit critical transitions where the system shifts abruptly from one state to another. Such critical transitions can have undesirable or even catastrophic consequences, including failure of space missions, power blackouts, extreme weather, extinction of species in ecosystems, pandemics, and sudden financial markets crash.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Recent work has shown that there is indeed an architecture to such transitions. It may appear surprising that disparate phenomena such as the instability of a power grid, extreme climatic events, and a thermoacoustic transition could have anything in common. More often than not, the behavior of complex systems is independent of the details of the problem, with fundamentally different physical systems displaying similar dynamic behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
        This seminar series plans to bring together experts from the applied and theoretical aspects of critical transitions. We plan to have talks spread across a broad spectrum, ranging from, but not limited to, climate science to combustion to financial markets to ecology to epidemiology to neuroscience. The seminar series is aimed at disseminating the state of the art in the prediction of critical transitions in these diverse fields of study, foster international collaborations and promote discussion. Each seminar will be conducted on the ## day of every month at ## IST (## CET, ## EST).
    </p>
    <p>
        If you would like to talk at our series, feel free to contact <a href = "mailto: ankitsahay02@gmail.com" style="text-decoration: none;">Ankit Sahay</a>. The presentation can           be either about your own work or on some interesting article related to critical transitions.
