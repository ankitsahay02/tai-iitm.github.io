    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to the homepage of the Online Seminar Series on Critical Transitions in Complex Systems, a monthly seminar series that focusses on "tipping points" or critical
        transitions in complex systems. Complex systems are characterized by the interactions that take place amongst different sub-components, forming a unified whole system.
        Tipping points have been observed over a wide variety of complex systems, from financial markets, to ecosystems, to the international economy, to the climate, to 
        combustion systems. In this series, we will try to bring researchers from different fields to talk about their work, with an emphasis on the interdisciplinary approach.
        Suggestions are always welcome!
        
    </p>
    <p>
        The seminars will usually be conducted around 10th and 20th of each month, at 2:00 pm - 3:00 pm on Zoom platform. The links for the upcoming talks will be made available
        in the schdule, and will also be sent via the mailing list.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you would like to talk at our series, feel free to contact <a href = "mailto: ankitsahay02@gmail.com">Ankit Sahay</a>.  The presentation can be either about your 
        own work or on some interesting article related to critical transitions.
    </p>

    <h2>Organizers</h2>
